# FIN4 System

## Structure

The project directory contains the following files and folders:
-	FIN4Contracts: Contains the prototypeâ€™s smart contracts as well as compilation and deployment scripts
-	FIN4Xplorer: Contains the React application
-	Ethereum-bridge: Contains the logic that Provable needs to forward on-chain requests to off-chain verifiers and vice versa
-	Docker-compose.yaml: Defines the containers that run the different services
-	.env: Sets the seed phrase used by the local ganache blockchain to enable the import of the accounts in MetaMask
-	.submodules: Handles the control of the FIN4Contracts and FIN4Xplorer directories that are individual repositories
-	ReadMe.md: Contains instructions for setting up and using the prototype and also troubleshooting


## Setup

1. Install Docker Desktop: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
2. Add MetaMask to your browser: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)
3. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/moritz-schindelmann-tum/ETH-FIN4.git`
4. `cd ETH-FIN4`

## Build the images / services

Run `docker-compose build`
Depending on your system and docker version, you could see some warnings in the console. You can ignore these warnings as long as the build finishes successfully.

## Start the system

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services in the detached mode.
2. Run `docker ps -a` to see all services.
3. Go to your browser and import the ganache ethereum accounts to your MetaMask with the following seed phrase: 
`season prevent fault almost then hungry lazy typical pipe exist recipe milk` 
Make sure to do this before you try to access the frontend in your browser. 
Choose localhost:8545 as the network that MetaMask connects to. If the import does not work at the first try. Switch to another network like ropsten, switch back and then import again.
4. Run `docker logs -f fin4xplorer` to follow the progress of the frontend startup (It make take a few minutes to start the front end). 
5. When the frontend server has started (which you will see in the console), you can access the frontend at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## How to use GUI

## Troubleshooting

1. localhost:3000 returns `Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Cannot destructure 'object null' as it is null.` This is probably due to a docker-compose down followed by docker-compose up -d 

  --> The account import from MetaMask did not work correctly. Please try it again.

2. The container fin4xplorer exits `docker-compose up` with the following message: `exec: ./wait-for-contracts.sh` not found.

or 

2. The container fin4contracts exits `docker-compose up` with the following message: `exec: ./compile-and-migrate.sh` not found.

--> Git windows might have automatically converted the file endings in the script files. 

Run `git config --global core.autocrlf false`
